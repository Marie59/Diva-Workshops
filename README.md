# DIVA Workshops and training

This page provides a set of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (examples and exercises) for the `DIVAnd` user workshops and training sessions organised in the frame of H2020 [SeaDataCloud](https://www.seadatanet.org/) project. The notebooks are also used in the [FAIR-EASE](https://fairease.eu/) project.    

[`Diva`](https://github.com/gher-uliege/DIVA) and [`DIVAnd`](https://github.com/gher-uliege/divand.jl) are software tools designed to generate gridded fields from in-situ observations.

Notebooks can be previewed with the service [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gher-uliege/Diva-Workshops/tree/master/notebooks/).

## Workshops

* The [1st workshop](https://gher-uliege.github.io/Diva-Workshops/Previous/Diva-workshop-2018-Liege.html) (Liège, 3-6 April 2018) was focused on the creation of gridded products and climatologies using `DIVAnd`.

* Within the 2nd SeaDataCloud training course (Ostend, 19-26 June 2019), the objective was to introduce participants to the `Julia` language, the Jupyter notebooks and the Virtual Research Environment deployed in the frame of the project.

* The [2nd workshop](https://gher-uliege.github.io/Diva-Workshops/2020/) (Bologna, 27-30 January 2020) was attended by beginners, intermediate and advanced users, and the goal was to help them create new products with `DIVAnd`.

## Installation

### Jupyter

Jupyter has to be installed in order to have a notebook interface.

### Extensions

It is also recommended to install the following modules which allow, for example, to have the sections automatically numbered:
- https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
- https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator

## Other relevant repositories

### [EMODnet-Chemistry-GriddedMaps](https://github.com/gher-uliege/EMODnet-Chemistry-GriddedMaps)

This project stores the notebooks and the instructions to produce the EMODnet Chemistry products (climatologies).

# Binder

Most notebooks need more resources that what is can currently available on Binder. The introduction notebooks (introduction to OI and variationa analysis) however work
