# DIVA Workshops

This page provides the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (examples and exercises) for the `DIVAnd` user workshops organised in the frame of H2020 [SeaDataCloud](https://www.seadatanet.org/) project.     

## Tools

[`Diva`](https://github.com/gher-ulg/DIVA) and [`DIVAnd`](https://github.com/gher-ulg/divand.jl) are software tools designed to generate gridded fields from in-situ observations.

## Objectives
The workshop is focused on the creation of gridded products and climatologies using `DIVAnd`

The organisational details are available https://gher-ulg.github.io/Diva-Workshops/.

Following the workshop, the notebooks have been updated, improved and corrected when necessary. New notebooks are developed based on the participants requirements.
