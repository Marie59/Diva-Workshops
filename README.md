# DIVA Workshops and training

This page provides the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (examples and exercises) for the `DIVAnd` user workshops and training sessions organised in the frame of H2020 [SeaDataCloud](https://www.seadatanet.org/) project.     

[`Diva`](https://github.com/gher-ulg/DIVA) and [`DIVAnd`](https://github.com/gher-ulg/divand.jl) are software tools designed to generate gridded fields from in-situ observations.

## Objectives

* The [1st workshop](https://gher-ulg.github.io/Diva-Workshops/Previous/Diva-workshop-2018-Liege.html) (Li√®ge, 3-6 April 2018) was focused on the creation of gridded products and climatologies using `DIVAnd`. The organizational details are available.

* Within the 2nd SeaDataCloud training course (19-26 June 2019), the objective is to introduce participants to the `Julia` language, the Jupyter notebooks and the new Virtual Research Environment.

* The [2nd workshop](https://gher-ulg.github.io/Diva-Workshops/2020/) (Bologna, 27-30 January 2020) was attended by beginners, intermediate and advanced users, and the goal was to help them create new products with `DIVAnd`.

## Recommendation for the products

# Binder

Most notebooks need more resources that what is can currently available on Binder. The introduction notebooks (introduction to OI and variationa analysis) however work
