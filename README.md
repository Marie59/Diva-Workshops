## Dates

From 2 to 6 of April, 2018. 

## Venue

The 2018 edition will take place in Liège, Belgium.

### How to get there?

By plane: 

**Brussel airport (Zaventem)** is served by international flights all year long. From the airport to Liège the easiest solution is the train, which leaves from level -2 of the airport. In addition to the ticket to Liège, all the travalers leaving or arriving at Brussels airport have to buy a so-called "Diablo ticket" (5€20) necessary to open the gates.

**Brussel south (Charleroi)** is also served by international flights and also low-cost companies. There is no train station so one needs to first take a bus to Charleroi train station (5€) then a train to Liège.

**Liège airport (Bierset)** receives only a few flights a day from touristic destination. If you are in that situation, this option might be convenient. From the airport to Liège, take either a taxi or a bus.

By train:

Liège Guillemin station is connected to London, Paris and Frankfurt.
