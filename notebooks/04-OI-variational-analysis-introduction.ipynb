    "The variational inverse method (VIM) or variational analysis ([Brasseur et al., 1996](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096706379600012X))\n",
    " aims to find a field with the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __smooth__\n",
    "* somewhat __close__ to first guess\n",
    "* __close__ to the observed values\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by defining a cost function which penalizes a field that doesn't satisfy those requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``__close__'' is quantified using the RMS error\n",
    "* ``__smooth__'' is quantified by averaging the  square of the first and second derivatives of the field (for a slowly varying field those derivatives are small).\n",
    "* those different requirements are weighted to define what is more important, a smooth field or a field close to observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equivalence between OI and variational analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The variational inverse method is identical to the optimal interpolation analysis if the weights are defined as the inverse of the covariance matrix used in optimal interpolation analysis.\n",
    "* This allows to compute the weights based on the error covariances\n",
    "* Error covariance can be obtained by the statistical behaviour of the field\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error fields by analogy with optimal interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Error fields can be derived since:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The optimal interpolation analysis is equivalent to VIM if the weights used by VIM are the inverse of the error covariances used by optimal interpolation.\n",
    "* In the context of optimal interpolation, it can be shown that the error field equals the analysis of the covariance fields\n",
    "* $\\Rightarrow$ error field of VIM equals analysis (by VIM) of covariance fields (the input of the analysis tool is a vector containing the covariance of data points with the point in which the error estimate is to be calculated)\n",
