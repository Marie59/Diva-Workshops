    "\n",
    "Julia is a high-level programming language for technical computing which allows you to manipulate and analyse large data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interesting features:\n",
    " * Julia is build from the ground for techical computing. \n",
    " * The language is close to the mathematical notation, for example to define a function $f(x) = 2x + 3$ in Julia is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "f(x) = 2x + 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    " * Julia is free and open-source software.\n",

    "### Differences from Matlab\n",
    "* Julia arrays are indexed with square brackets, `A[i,j]`.\n",
    "* Julia arrays are assigned by reference. After A=B, changing elements of B will modify A as well.\n",
    "* Julia function parameters are passed and assigned by reference. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller.\n",
    "* A bang (!) indicates if a function changes one of its argument\n",
    "* In Julia, parentheses must be used to call a function with zero arguments, like in tic() and toc().\n",
    "* Julia's single quotes enclose characters, not strings.\n",
    "* Julia does not automatically grow arrays in an assignment statement. \n",
    "* Scope of variables in a loop are local: \n",
    "\n",
    "   for i = 1:10\n",
    "        z = i\n",
    "   end\n",
    "\n",
    "  will result in undefined z after the loop unless defined before the loop \n",
    "* In matlab, ranges are somtimes enclosed with brackets, e.g. `[1:10]`. This is also valid Julia code, but it generates a vector whose single element is a range from 1 to 10. To declare a range Julia, simply use `1:10` without the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference from Python\n",
    "* Julia requires end to end a block.\n",
    "* In Julia, indexing of arrays, strings, etc. is 1-based not 0-based.\n",
    "* Julia's slice indexing includes the last element, unlike in Python. `a[2:3]` in Julia is `a[1:3]` in Python.\n",
    "* Julia does not support negative indexes. In particular, the last element of a list or array is indexed with end in Julia, not -1 as in Python.\n",

       "\n",
       "You will need to have the Python [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library installed on your machine in order to use PyPlot.  You can either do inline plotting with [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), which doesn't require a GUI backend, or use the Qt, wx, or GTK+ backends of Matplotlib as described below.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once Matplotlib is installed, then you can just use `Pkg.add(\"PyPlot\")` in Julia to install PyPlot and its dependencies.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Automated Matplotlib installation\n",
       "\n",
       "If you set up PyCall to use the [Conda.jl](https://github.com/Luthaf/Conda.jl) package to install a private (not in the system `PATH`) Julia Python distribution (via Miniconda), then PyPlot will automatically install Matplotlib as needed.\n",
       "\n",

       "Pkg.build(\"PyCall\")\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "The next time you import `PyPlot`, it will tell Conda to install Matplotlib.\n",
       "\n",
       "### OS X\n",
       "\n",
       "On MacOS, you should either install [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/) for MacOS 10.9 or later or install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) Python distribution in order to get a fully functional PyPlot.\n",
       "\n",
       "MacOS 10.9 comes with Python and Matplotlib, but this version of Matplotlib defaults to with the Cocoa GUI backend, which is [not supported by PyPlot](https://github.com/stevengj/PyPlot.jl/issues/11). It also has a Tk backend, which is supported, but the Tk backend does not work unless you install XQuartz.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "(You may want to add the two `export` commands to your `~/.profile` file so that they are automatically executed whenever you start a shell.)\n",
       "\n",
       "## Basic usage\n",
       "\n",
       "Once Matplotlib and PyPlot are installed, and you are using a graphics-capable Julia environment such as IJulia, you can simply type `using PyPlot` and begin calling functions in the [matplotlib.pyplot](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) API. For example:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "using PyPlot\n",
       "x = linspace(0,2*pi,1000); y = sin.(3 * x + 4 * cos.(2 * x));\n",
       "plot(x, y, color=\"red\", linewidth=2.0, linestyle=\"--\")\n",
       "title(\"A sinusoidally modulated sinusoid\")\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "In general, all of the arguments, including keyword arguments, are exactly the same as in Python.  (With minor translations, of course, e.g. Julia uses `true` and `nothing` instead of Python's `True` and `None`.)\n",
       "\n",
       "The full `matplotlib.pyplot` API is far too extensive to describe here; see the [matplotlib.pyplot documentation for more information](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html).  The Matplotlib version number is returned by `PyPlot.version`.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Exported functions\n",
       "\n",
       "Only the currently documented `matplotlib.pyplot` API is exported.  To use other functions in the module, you can also call `matplotlib.pyplot.foo(...)` as `plt[:foo](...)`.  For example, `plt[:plot](x, y)` also works.  (And the raw `PyObject` for the `matplotlib` modules is also accessible as `PyPlot.matplotlib`.)\n",
       "\n",
       "Matplotlib is somewhat inconsistent about capitalization: it has `contour3D` but `bar3d`, etcetera.  PyPlot renames all such functions to use a capital *D* (e.g. it has `hist2D`, `bar3D`, and so on).\n",
       "\n",
       "You must also use `plt` to access some functions that conflict with built-in Julia functions.  In particular `plt[:hist]`, `plt[:xcorr]`, and `plt[:isinteractive]` must be used to access `matplotlib.pyplot.hist` etcetera.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you wish to access *all* of the PyPlot functions exclusively through `plt.somefunction(...)`, as is conventional in Python, you can do `import PyPlot; const plt = PyPlot` instead of `using PyPlot`.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Figure objects\n",
       "\n",
       "You can get the current figure as a `Figure` object (a wrapper around `matplotlib.pyplot.Figure`) by calling `gcf()`.  \n",
       "\n",
       "The `Figure` type supports Julia's [multimedia I/O API](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/base/#multimedia-i-o), so you can use `display(fig)` to show a `fig::PyFigure` and `show(io, mime, fig)` (or `writemime` in Julia 0.4) to write it to a given `mime` type string (e.g. `\"image/png\"` or `\"application/pdf\"`) that is supported by the Matplotlib backend.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Non-interactive plotting\n",
       "\n",
       "If you use PyPlot from an interactive Julia prompt, such as the Julia [command-line prompt](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/interacting-with-julia/) or an IJulia notebook, then plots appear immediately after a plotting function (`plot` etc.) is evaluated.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, if you use PyPlot from a Julia script that is run non-interactively (e.g. `julia myscript.jl`), then Matplotlib is executed in [non-interactive mode](http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-interactive-mode): a plot window is not opened until you run `show()` (equivalent to `plt.show()` in the Python examples).\n",
       "\n",
       "## Interactive versus Julia graphics\n",
       "\n",
       "PyPlot can use any Julia graphics backend capable of displaying PNG, SVG, or PDF images, such as the IJulia environment.  To use a different backend, simply call `pushdisplay` with the desired `Display`; see the [Julia multimedia display API](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/io-network/#multimedia-i-o) for more detail.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, you may wish to use one of the Python Matplotlib backends to open an interactive window for each plot (for interactive zooming, panning, etcetera).  You can do this at any time by running:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "pygui(true)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "to turn on the Python-based GUI (if possible) for subsequent plots, while `pygui(false)` will return to the Julia backend.  Even when a Python GUI is running, you can display the current figure with the Julia backend by running `display(gcf())`.\n",
       "\n",
       "If no Julia graphics backend is available when PyPlot is imported, then `pygui(true)` is the default.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Choosing a Python GUI toolkit\n",
       "\n",
       "Only the [Tk](http://www.tcl.tk/), [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/), [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/) (version 2 or 3), and [Qt](http://qt-project.org/) (version 4 or 5; via the PyQt5,  [PyQt4](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt4) or [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)), Python GUI backends are supported by PyPlot.  (Obviously, you must have installed one of these toolkits for Python first.)  By default, PyPlot picks one of these when it starts up (based on what you have installed), but you can force a specific toolkit to be chosen by importing the PyCall module and using its `pygui` function to set a Python backend *before* importing PyPlot:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "using PyCall\n",
       "pygui(gui)\n",
       "using PyPlot\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "where `gui` can currently be one of `:tk`, `:gtk3`, `:gtk`, `:qt5`, `:qt4`, `:qt`, or `:wx`. You can also set a default via the Matplotlib `rcParams['backend']` parameter in your [matplotlibrc](http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html) file.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Color maps\n",
       "\n",
       "The PyPlot module also exports some functions and types based on the [matplotlib.colors](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html) and [matplotlib.cm](http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html) modules to simplify management of color maps (which are used to assign values to colors in various plot types).  In particular:\n",
       "\n",
       "  * `ColorMap`: a wrapper around the [matplotlib.colors.Colormap](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.Colormap) type.  The following constructors are provided:\n",
       "\n",
       "      * `ColorMap{T<:Colorant}(name::String, c::AbstractVector{T}, n=256, gamma=1.0)` constructs an `n`-component colormap by [linearly interpolating](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap) the colors in the array `c` of `Colorant`s (from the [ColorTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorTypes.jl) package).  If you want a `name` to be constructed automatically, call `ColorMap(c, n=256, gamma=1.0)` instead.  Alternatively, instead of passing an array of colors, you can pass a 3- or 4-column matrix of RGB or RGBA components, respectively (similar to [ListedColorMap](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap) in Matplotlib).\n",
       "      * Even more general color maps may be defined by passing arrays of (x,y0,y1) tuples for the red, green, blue, and (optionally) alpha components, as defined by the [matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap) constructor, via: `ColorMap{T<:Real}(name::String, r::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, g::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, b::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, n=256, gamma=1.0)` or `ColorMap{T<:Real}(name::String, r::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, g::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, b::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, alpha::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, n=256, gamma=1.0)`\n",
       "      * `ColorMap(name::String)` returns an existing (registered) colormap, equivalent to [matplotlib.cm.get_cmap](http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html#matplotlib.cm.get_cmap)(`name`).\n",
       "      * `matplotlib.colors.Colormap` objects returned by Python functions are automatically converted to the `ColorMap` type.\n",
       "  * `get_cmap(name::String)` or `get_cmap(name::String, lut::Integer)` call the [matplotlib.cm.get_cmap](http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html#matplotlib.cm.get_cmap) function.\n",
       "  * `register_cmap(c::ColorMap)` or `register_cmap(name::String, c::ColorMap)` call the [matplotlib.cm.register_cmap](http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html#matplotlib.cm.register_cmap) function.\n",
       "  * `get_cmaps()` returns a `Vector{ColorMap}` of the currently registered colormaps.\n",
       "\n",
       "Note that, given an SVG-supporting display environment like IJulia, `ColorMap` and `Vector{ColorMap}` objects are displayed graphically; try `get_cmaps()`!\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3d Plotting\n",
       "\n",
       "The PyPlot package also imports functions from Matplotlib's [mplot3d](http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/) toolkit. Unlike Matplotlib, however, you can create 3d plots directly without first creating an [Axes3d](http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/api.html#axes3d) object, simply by calling one of: `bar3D`, `contour3D`, `contourf3D`, `plot3D`, `plot_surface`, `plot_trisurf`, `plot_wireframe`, or `scatter3D` (as well as `text2D`, `text3D`), exactly like the correspondingly named methods of [Axes3d](http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/api.html#axes3d). We also export the Matlab-like synonyms `surf` for `plot_surface` (or `plot_trisurf` for 1d-array arguments) and `mesh` for `plot_wireframe`.  For example, you can do:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "surf(rand(30,40))\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "to plot a random 30×40 surface mesh.\n",
       "\n",
       "You can also explicitly create a subplot with 3d axes via, for example, `subplot(111, projection=\"3d\")`, exactly as in Matplotlib. The `Axes3D` constructor and the [art3D](http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/api.html#art3d) module are also exported.\n",
       "\n",
       "## LaTeX plot labels\n",
       "\n",
       "Matplotlib allows you to [use LaTeX equations in plot labels](http://matplotlib.org/users/mathtext.html), titles, and so on simply by enclosing the equations in dollar signs (`$ ... $`) within the string.  However, typing LaTeX equations in Julia string literals is awkward because escaping is necessary to prevent Julia from interpreting the dollar signs and backslashes itself; for example, the LaTeX equation `$\\alpha + \\beta$` would be the literal string `\"\\$\\\\alpha + \\\\beta\\$\"` in Julia.\n",
       "\n",
       "To simplify this, PyPlot uses the [LaTeXStrings package](https://github.com/stevengj/LaTeXStrings.jl) to provide a new `LaTeXString` type that be constructed via `L\"....\"` without escaping backslashes or dollar signs.  For example, one can simply write `L\"$\\alpha + \\beta$\"` for the abovementioned equation, and thus you can do things like:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "title(L\"Plot of $\\Gamma_3(x)$\")\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "If your string contains *only* equations, you can omit the dollar signs, e.g. `L\"\\alpha + \\beta\"`, and they will be added automatically. As an added benefit, a `LaTeXString` is automatically displayed as a rendered equation in IJulia.  See the LaTeXStrings package for more information.\n",
       "\n",
       "## SVG output in IJulia\n",
       "\n",
       "By default, plots in IJulia are sent to the notebook as PNG images. Optionally, you can tell PyPlot to display plots in the browser as [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) images, which have the advantage of being resolution-independent (so that they display without pixellation at high-resolutions, for example if you convert an IJulia notebook to PDF), by running:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "PyPlot.svg(true)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This is not the default because SVG plots in the browser are much slower to display (especially for complex plots) and may display inaccurately in some browsers with buggy SVG support.  The `PyPlot.svg()` method returns whether SVG display is currently enabled.\n",
       "\n",
       "Note that this is entirely separate from manually exporting plots to SVG or any other format.  Regardless of whether PyPlot uses SVG for browser display, you can export a plot to SVG at any time by using the Matplotlib [savefig](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.savefig) command, e.g. `savefig(\"plot.svg\")`.\n",

       "Only the currently documented `matplotlib.pyplot` API is exported.  To use other functions in the module, you can also call `matplotlib.pyplot.foo(...)` as `plt[:foo](...)`.  For example, `plt[:plot](x, y)` also works.  (And the raw `PyObject` for the `matplotlib` modules is also accessible as `PyPlot.matplotlib`.)\n",
       "\n",
       "Matplotlib is somewhat inconsistent about capitalization: it has `contour3D` but `bar3d`, etcetera.  PyPlot renames all such functions to use a capital *D* (e.g. it has `hist2D`, `bar3D`, and so on).\n",
       "\n",
       "You must also use `plt` to access some functions that conflict with built-in Julia functions.  In particular `plt[:hist]`, `plt[:xcorr]`, and `plt[:isinteractive]` must be used to access `matplotlib.pyplot.hist` etcetera.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you wish to access *all* of the PyPlot functions exclusively through `plt.somefunction(...)`, as is conventional in Python, you can do `import PyPlot; const plt = PyPlot` instead of `using PyPlot`.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Figure objects\n",
       "\n",
       "You can get the current figure as a `Figure` object (a wrapper around `matplotlib.pyplot.Figure`) by calling `gcf()`.  \n",
       "\n",
       "The `Figure` type supports Julia's [multimedia I/O API](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/base/#multimedia-i-o), so you can use `display(fig)` to show a `fig::PyFigure` and `show(io, mime, fig)` (or `writemime` in Julia 0.4) to write it to a given `mime` type string (e.g. `\"image/png\"` or `\"application/pdf\"`) that is supported by the Matplotlib backend.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Non-interactive plotting\n",
       "\n",
       "If you use PyPlot from an interactive Julia prompt, such as the Julia [command-line prompt](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/interacting-with-julia/) or an IJulia notebook, then plots appear immediately after a plotting function (`plot` etc.) is evaluated.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, if you use PyPlot from a Julia script that is run non-interactively (e.g. `julia myscript.jl`), then Matplotlib is executed in [non-interactive mode](http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-interactive-mode): a plot window is not opened until you run `show()` (equivalent to `plt.show()` in the Python examples).\n",
       "\n",
       "## Interactive versus Julia graphics\n",
       "\n",
       "PyPlot can use any Julia graphics backend capable of displaying PNG, SVG, or PDF images, such as the IJulia environment.  To use a different backend, simply call `pushdisplay` with the desired `Display`; see the [Julia multimedia display API](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/io-network/#multimedia-i-o) for more detail.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, you may wish to use one of the Python Matplotlib backends to open an interactive window for each plot (for interactive zooming, panning, etcetera).  You can do this at any time by running:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "pygui(true)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "to turn on the Python-based GUI (if possible) for subsequent plots, while `pygui(false)` will return to the Julia backend.  Even when a Python GUI is running, you can display the current figure with the Julia backend by running `display(gcf())`.\n",
       "\n",
       "If no Julia graphics backend is available when PyPlot is imported, then `pygui(true)` is the default.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Choosing a Python GUI toolkit\n",
       "\n",
       "Only the [Tk](http://www.tcl.tk/), [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/), [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/) (version 2 or 3), and [Qt](http://qt-project.org/) (version 4 or 5; via the PyQt5,  [PyQt4](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt4) or [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)), Python GUI backends are supported by PyPlot.  (Obviously, you must have installed one of these toolkits for Python first.)  By default, PyPlot picks one of these when it starts up (based on what you have installed), but you can force a specific toolkit to be chosen by importing the PyCall module and using its `pygui` function to set a Python backend *before* importing PyPlot:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "using PyCall\n",
       "pygui(gui)\n",
       "using PyPlot\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "where `gui` can currently be one of `:tk`, `:gtk3`, `:gtk`, `:qt5`, `:qt4`, `:qt`, or `:wx`. You can also set a default via the Matplotlib `rcParams['backend']` parameter in your [matplotlibrc](http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html) file.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Color maps\n",
       "\n",
       "The PyPlot module also exports some functions and types based on the [matplotlib.colors](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html) and [matplotlib.cm](http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html) modules to simplify management of color maps (which are used to assign values to colors in various plot types).  In particular:\n",
       "\n",
       "  * `ColorMap`: a wrapper around the [matplotlib.colors.Colormap](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.Colormap) type.  The following constructors are provided:\n",
       "\n",
       "      * `ColorMap{T<:Colorant}(name::String, c::AbstractVector{T}, n=256, gamma=1.0)` constructs an `n`-component colormap by [linearly interpolating](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap) the colors in the array `c` of `Colorant`s (from the [ColorTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorTypes.jl) package).  If you want a `name` to be constructed automatically, call `ColorMap(c, n=256, gamma=1.0)` instead.  Alternatively, instead of passing an array of colors, you can pass a 3- or 4-column matrix of RGB or RGBA components, respectively (similar to [ListedColorMap](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap) in Matplotlib).\n",
       "      * Even more general color maps may be defined by passing arrays of (x,y0,y1) tuples for the red, green, blue, and (optionally) alpha components, as defined by the [matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap) constructor, via: `ColorMap{T<:Real}(name::String, r::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, g::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, b::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, n=256, gamma=1.0)` or `ColorMap{T<:Real}(name::String, r::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, g::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, b::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, alpha::AbstractVector{(T,T,T)}, n=256, gamma=1.0)`\n",
       "      * `ColorMap(name::String)` returns an existing (registered) colormap, equivalent to [matplotlib.cm.get_cmap](http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html#matplotlib.cm.get_cmap)(`name`).\n",
       "      * `matplotlib.colors.Colormap` objects returned by Python functions are automatically converted to the `ColorMap` type.\n",
       "  * `get_cmap(name::String)` or `get_cmap(name::String, lut::Integer)` call the [matplotlib.cm.get_cmap](http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html#matplotlib.cm.get_cmap) function.\n",
       "  * `register_cmap(c::ColorMap)` or `register_cmap(name::String, c::ColorMap)` call the [matplotlib.cm.register_cmap](http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html#matplotlib.cm.register_cmap) function.\n",
       "  * `get_cmaps()` returns a `Vector{ColorMap}` of the currently registered colormaps.\n",
       "\n",
       "Note that, given an SVG-supporting display environment like IJulia, `ColorMap` and `Vector{ColorMap}` objects are displayed graphically; try `get_cmaps()`!\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3d Plotting\n",
       "\n",
       "The PyPlot package also imports functions from Matplotlib's [mplot3d](http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/) toolkit. Unlike Matplotlib, however, you can create 3d plots directly without first creating an [Axes3d](http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/api.html#axes3d) object, simply by calling one of: `bar3D`, `contour3D`, `contourf3D`, `plot3D`, `plot_surface`, `plot_trisurf`, `plot_wireframe`, or `scatter3D` (as well as `text2D`, `text3D`), exactly like the correspondingly named methods of [Axes3d](http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/api.html#axes3d). We also export the Matlab-like synonyms `surf` for `plot_surface` (or `plot_trisurf` for 1d-array arguments) and `mesh` for `plot_wireframe`.  For example, you can do:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "surf(rand(30,40))\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "to plot a random 30×40 surface mesh.\n",
       "\n",
       "You can also explicitly create a subplot with 3d axes via, for example, `subplot(111, projection=\"3d\")`, exactly as in Matplotlib. The `Axes3D` constructor and the [art3D](http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/api.html#art3d) module are also exported.\n",
       "\n",
       "## LaTeX plot labels\n",
       "\n",
       "Matplotlib allows you to [use LaTeX equations in plot labels](http://matplotlib.org/users/mathtext.html), titles, and so on simply by enclosing the equations in dollar signs (`$ ... $`) within the string.  However, typing LaTeX equations in Julia string literals is awkward because escaping is necessary to prevent Julia from interpreting the dollar signs and backslashes itself; for example, the LaTeX equation `$\\alpha + \\beta$` would be the literal string `\"\\$\\\\alpha + \\\\beta\\$\"` in Julia.\n",
       "\n",
       "To simplify this, PyPlot uses the [LaTeXStrings package](https://github.com/stevengj/LaTeXStrings.jl) to provide a new `LaTeXString` type that be constructed via `L\"....\"` without escaping backslashes or dollar signs.  For example, one can simply write `L\"$\\alpha + \\beta$\"` for the abovementioned equation, and thus you can do things like:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "title(L\"Plot of $\\Gamma_3(x)$\")\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "If your string contains *only* equations, you can omit the dollar signs, e.g. `L\"\\alpha + \\beta\"`, and they will be added automatically. As an added benefit, a `LaTeXString` is automatically displayed as a rendered equation in IJulia.  See the LaTeXStrings package for more information.\n",
       "\n",
       "## SVG output in IJulia\n",
       "\n",
       "By default, plots in IJulia are sent to the notebook as PNG images. Optionally, you can tell PyPlot to display plots in the browser as [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) images, which have the advantage of being resolution-independent (so that they display without pixellation at high-resolutions, for example if you convert an IJulia notebook to PDF), by running:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "PyPlot.svg(true)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This is not the default because SVG plots in the browser are much slower to display (especially for complex plots) and may display inaccurately in some browsers with buggy SVG support.  The `PyPlot.svg()` method returns whether SVG display is currently enabled.\n",
       "\n",
       "Note that this is entirely separate from manually exporting plots to SVG or any other format.  Regardless of whether PyPlot uses SVG for browser display, you can export a plot to SVG at any time by using the Matplotlib [savefig](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.savefig) command, e.g. `savefig(\"plot.svg\")`.\n",
